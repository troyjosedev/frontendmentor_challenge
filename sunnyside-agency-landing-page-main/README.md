## My process
  Adopting a mobile-first approach and focusing on creating a solution that works well between the screen sizes of 375px and 1440px. Have been relearning animation techniques to achieve a bouncing effect for an arrow element. Additionally, I'm conducting research on implementing a hamburger menu for my project.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  During my recent exploration of CSS, I gained knowledge about the filter property and its various capabilities. By using the filter property, I can apply visual effects to elements in a flexible and creative way. One specific use case I discovered was the brightness() function, which allows me to adjust the brightness of an element by specifying a value between 0 and 1. This is particularly useful for creating dark or light mode themes.

  Another interesting aspect of the filter property is the invert() function. It enables me to invert the colors of an element, effectively flipping the color scheme. This can be a great way to create visual contrast or achieve unique design effects.

  Furthermore, I learned how to apply smooth transitions to the filter property. By specifying a transition duration and an easing function, I can create gradual and visually appealing changes when hovering or interacting with elements.

  Overall, the filter property has opened up new possibilities for me to enhance the visual aspects of my web designs and create engaging user experiences. I'm excited to explore more creative applications of this property in future projects.

### Continued development

  I am currently focused on advancing my skills in animating cross menu animations, image slideshows, modals, and other interactive elements. These features play a crucial role in creating engaging and dynamic user experiences on websites. By honing my abilities in these areas, I aim to bring life and interactivity to my web projects, making them more visually appealing and user-friendly. I will continue my learning journey, exploring different animation techniques and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in web development. With each new project, I strive to improve my proficiency in implementing these elements seamlessly and effectively.
