## Overview
  This challenge will test your ability to create dropdown navigation menus, a common pattern on larger sites. It will also provide some nice basic layout challenges.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

 I have recently refreshed my knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) in order to better understand how to create dropdown menus. To create a dropdown menu, developers can use HTML and CSS to define the structure and styling, while JavaScript and the DOM provide the necessary functionality. The DOM allows you to handle events, such as clicks or hover actions, and dynamically modify the menu's visibility, content, and styling based on user interactions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES6
- SSCS

### What I learned

I learn that the DOM and its role in implementing dropdown menus is crucial for web developers. By leveraging the power of the DOM, you can create interactive and user-friendly dropdown menus that enhance the overall browsing experience.

### Continued development

If I possess a sufficient level of confidence in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will proceed with developing a project using React and concentrate my efforts on it.
